The 1.0.0 release of the {comorbidity} package consists of a vast rewrite of the package API and internals, which unfortunately introduces a variety of breaking changes by modifying the behaviour of the user-facing `comorbidity()` function.
This article describes some of the changes, including some examples using simulated data and comparisons with the previous API.

The simulated dataset (with 10 subjects and a total of 250 ICD codes) that we will be using throughout this article can be generated as follows:

```{r}
library(comorbidity)

set.seed(2837465)

sim_data <- data.frame(
  id = sample(x = seq(10), size = 250, replace = TRUE),
  code = sample_diag(n = 250)
)
sim_data <- sim_data[order(sim_data$id), ]
str(sim_data)
```

We use ICD-10 only (to simplify this document), but everything applies to ICD-9 as well (with the obvious adjustments).

# Comorbidity Mapping and Scoring are Now Distinct Functions

With the previous release of {comorbidity}, the comorbidity mapping and scoring algorithms were applied jointly with a single function call:

```r
comorbidity(x = sim_data, id = "id", code = "code", score = "charlson", icd = "icd10", assign0 = FALSE)

#> 10    0        0    0     1   1-2      2    1-2
```

Note that, as of {comorbidity} version 1.0.4, the `ami` condition has been renamed to `mi`.
See [#53](https://github.com/ellessenne/comorbidity/issues/53) on GitHub for more details.

Now, we first need to apply the mapping algorithm:

```{r}
com <- comorbidity(x = sim_data, id = "id", code = "code", map = "charlson_icd10_quan", assign0 = FALSE)
com
```

...which yields the same results shown above.

Then, if we need to calculate comorbidity scores, we can use the `score()` function:

```{r}
score(com, assign0 = FALSE, weights = NULL)
```

This yields unweighted scores (e.g. equivalent to the `score` column above).
If we need weighted scores (e.g. the `wscore` column above, which assumes the old Charlson score weights from 1987), we can pass the name of a supported scoring algorithm:

```{r}
score(com, assign0 = FALSE, weights = "charlson")
```

Once again, all the results from the `score()` function are equivalent to what we obtained using the previously-released version.

# Supported Mapping and Scoring Algorithms

The new version includes updated comorbidity mapping and scoring algorithms.
Furthermore, it is designed in such a way that should simplify the addition of new scores in the future.
The currently supported comorbidity mapping algorithms are described in the following vignette:

```r
vignette("02-comorbidityscores", package = "comorbidity")
```

Alternatively, a new function is provided to display supported algorithms in the R console:

```{r}
available_algorithms()
```

This is picked up _auto-magically_ from the internal data structures, so it *should* always be up-to-date.

# Computational Speed

The internal re-writing of the package API allowed optimising code for speed and efficiency.
We managed to estimate, using simulated data, that the main comorbidity mapping function (e.g. `comorbidity()`) should be approximately twice as fast as version 0.5.3, across a variety of sample sizes:

<img src="https://github.com/ellessenne/comorbidity/raw/master/inst/Timing/plot.png" width="100%" alt="Plot highlighting the fold improvement in computational speed when running the version 1.0.0 of {comorbidity} compared to version 0.5.3.">

This is the main computational bottleneck, as applying the scoring algorithm should be very fast in general.

# Reverting to previous release

I understand that this new release might break some workflows, so apologies for that.
If you have some feedback, please feel free to e-mail the maintainer of the package or to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ellessenne/comorbidity/issues), the latter being strongly suggested.

Finally, if required, you can revert to the previous release by installing from GitHub:

```r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("ellessenne/comorbidity@0.5.3")
```

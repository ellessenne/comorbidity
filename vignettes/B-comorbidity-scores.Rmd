The {comorbidity} R package can be used to identify comorbidity conditions and calculate comorbidity scores based on ICD codes data.
Supported mapping and weighting algorithms are described below, including relevant references.

Examples showing how to apply each algorithm are included in a separate vignette.

# Supported Mapping Algorithms

The {comorbidity} package can apply comorbidity mappings corresponding to the Charlson and the Elixhauser comorbidity scores.
Both ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding systems are supported, with algorithms described in the paper by Quan et al. (2005).
The resulting mapping algorithms are denoted with `charlson_icd9_quan` and `charlson_icd10_quan` for the Charlson score (based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 systems, respectively), `elixhauser_icd9_quan` and `elixhauser_icd10_quan` for the Elixhauser score.

Furthermore, the Swedish (Ludvigsson et al., 2021) and Australian (Sundararajan et al., 2004) modifications of the Charlson score are implemented as well, and identified by `charlson_icd10_se` and `charlson_icd10_am` respectively.

# Supported Weighting Algorithms

Different weighting algorithms have been proposed to combine the different conditions into a single measure, for both the Charlson and the Elixhauser index.

Currently, the following weighting algorithms are supported for the Charlson score:

* The original weights by Charlson et al. (1987), denoted with `charlson`;

* Updated weights by Quan et al. (2011), denoted with `quan`.

Then, for the Elixhauser score:

* Weights proposed by van Walraven et al. (2009), denoted with `vw`;

* The Swiss weights modification by Sharma et al. (2021), denoted with `swiss`.
